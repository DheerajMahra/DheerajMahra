## 👋 Hi there

I'm currently building conversational experiences at [Active.Ai](https://active.ai), working mostly with React ecosystem.

I code side projects whenever I get time. You can check them out below or visit my [website](https://dheerajmahra.now.sh) to know more. Plus, I share my frontend journey on my Instagram page, [madsemicolon](https://instagram.com/madsemicolon) ✌️

My 2021 learning list includes React-testing-library with Jest till June, and TypeScript afterwards.
